# Developer Portfolio Website
**Tagline:** Showcasing code, craft, and creativity — built to perform.

## Overview
A sleek, SEO‑optimized portfolio that demonstrates my front‑end approach: clean architecture, fast loads, and content you can edit without touching JSX. The site is Markdown‑driven, ships with per‑page OG tags, and includes project routes with shareable previews.

## Highlights
- Responsive layout with accessible semantics
- Markdown‑driven pages (hero, about, projects, contact)
- Per‑route SEO with Open Graph / Twitter cards
- Lightweight animations and fast LCP
- Centralized content JSON for easy reuse

## Tech Stack
**React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, react‑helmet‑async, react‑router, Docker (deploy ready)**

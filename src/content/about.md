# About Me

I’m **Kyle O’Neill**, a Senior Full-Stack Engineer and Technical Lead with more than 10 years of experience building scalable, high-performance applications for enterprise environments. I’ve led cross-functional teams at organizations like **The University of Texas at Austin**, **Sapient Global Markets**, and my own consultancy, **Code Scribe LLC**, where I deliver impactful software that scales.

From transforming legacy PHP monoliths into **modular Node.js + Angular platforms**, to integrating **ArcGIS** for advanced geospatial analysis, to implementing **Elasticsearch** for instant global search — my work consistently improves performance, data accuracy, and user experience.

I’m passionate about **clean code**, **performance optimization**, and **empowering teams** to build better, faster, and smarter. Whether architecting a new system from the ground up or mentoring engineers through a tough refactor, I bring a mix of deep technical skill and strategic vision to every project.
